there are few commands to start initially with git or git-hub.
few of that commands are
1] git init --> to initialise empty git reposetory
2] git status --> to check status of code file
3] git add --> to track all git file in git repo
4] git commit --> to commit code file or to create versions of code file
5] git log --> to show timeline where all versions are listed
6] git configure user.name "name" -->> to change author name
7] git configure user.email -->> to change registered mail

NOTE: --global , --system options can be use in last to commands as per the requirement and nature of the code.

--global use to change authore name for particular user you are working with e.g, root user.
--system use to change authore name for all git repo made with all users in the system.

8] git clone "link" -->> to download code from github
9] git remote add "name" "link" -->> to push directory to github
10] git push "name" master -->> to show error

in case we want to push it on github, following steps can be used :

first create an account on github.
then create youre repository graphically on your github account.
then copy http link of your repository you have created. 
after that go to the setting option on your profile then click on developer setting (Last)
then create token from and save it to notepad cuz it wont be visible again on github.
